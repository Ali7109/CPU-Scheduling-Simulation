# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulations

## Description

This project implements common CPU Scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Served, Shortest-Job-First, Priority, as well as more industry-standard algorithms such as Round Robin and Priority Round Robin.

## Implementation details
- Implemented in C for simulating the algorithms, accompanied by an automated build Makefile.
- Note: this simulation is not specific to any operating system, it simply illustrates the fundamental concepts behind the algorithms.
